## 🌟 About This Repository
- **Purpose**: To track my learning milestones, share projects, and upload code snippets as I improve my Python skills.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Core Python syntax and features
  - Data structures and algorithms
  - Building small projects
  - Learning through real-world challenges

## 📚 Current Progress
Here's an overview of what I'm working on:
1. **Basics of Python**:
   - Variables, data types, and operators
   - Loops and conditionals
2. **Projects**:
   - [Simple Task Manager](path-to-code)
   - Weather application (coming soon!)
3. **Future Goals**:
   - Learn object-oriented programming
   - Work with external libraries and APIs
   - Build a web application using Python frameworks
